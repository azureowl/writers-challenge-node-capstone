## "Word Seed" | Thinkful Node Capstone
Sow words across the blank white page, invite the creative Muse for a quick romp with a writing prompt, and allow new vocabulary to take root in memory with Word Seed, a writing goal app that is designed for writers who want to exercise their mind, hone their skills, and expand their vocabulary. Users can set a monthly goal, see their progress, and create different notebooks to fit their creative needs.
